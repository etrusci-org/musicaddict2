### SPOILERS

- You start with 7â—ˆ cash. Since you're addicted to music, you'll never stop digging for more records. Sometimes you discover a very interesting one, and buy it, just to go right back to digging.

- After a while someone may offer you cash for a record in your collection, and you sell it for profit.

- With more cash comes the ability/chance to buy higher priced records, and thus make better profits when selling.
