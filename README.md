## GETTING INTO THE GAME

### FIRST TIME PLAYERS

This will give you a new **Secret Token** and put you into the game. **Store it somewhere safe. It can not be recovered.**

1. Enter a **Player Name** (can be changed later) or leave it empty to play as *Anonymous*.
2. Click the **REGISTER** button.

### RETURNING PLAYERS

This will load your previous progress and put you into the game.

1. Enter your **Secret Token**.
2. Click the **Continue** button.

Note: The app will remember your **Secret Token** by storing it to the local storage of your web-browser (if available), and enter it for you when you return. But this is bound to the current device your on and may get lost if you clear all your browser data. Better you store it somewhere safe.

## PLAYING THE GAME

In a nutshell: click the **PROGRESS** button a lot. What happens follows specific rules. It also depends on what happened before, sometimes passed time, and luck.

Your progress will be auto-saved every now and then, or when you click the **EXIT** button.

If you want to know more what happens before you begin, read the spoilers section below.

## SPOILERS

You start with 7◈ cash. Since you're addicted to music, you'll never stop digging for more records. Sometimes you discover a very interesting one, and buy it, just to go right back to digging.

After a while someone may offer you cash for a record in your collection, and you sell it for profit.

With more cash comes the ability/chance to buy higher priced records, and thus make better profits when selling.
