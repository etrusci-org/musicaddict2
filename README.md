## Getting Into The Game

To begin, open your web-browser an go to: <https://etrusci.org/play/musicaddict2>

### First Time Players

This will give you a new **Secret Token** and put you into the game. Store it somewhere safe. It can not be recovered.

1. Enter a **Player Name** (can be changed later) or leave it empty to play as *Anonymous*.
2. Click the **REGISTER** button.

### Returning Players

This will load your previous progress and put you into the game.

1. Enter your **Secret Token**.
2. Click the **Continue** button.

### Keep Your Secret Token Safe

Although the app will remember your **Secret Token** by storing it in the local storage of your web-browser (if available), and will enter it for you when you return (so you can just click the **CONTINUE** button), it's bound to the current device your on and may get lost if you clear all your browser data.

## Playing The Game

In a nutshell: click the **PROGRESS** button a lot. What happens follows specific rules. It also depends on what happened before, sometimes passed time, and luck.

Your progress will be auto-saved every now and then, or when you click the **EXIT** button.

---

## Your Progress Data

As long as you have your secret token and the server doesn't explode, you will be able to load your previous progress.

There are some cases where it can get lost:

- If you don't login for at least 12 months.
- If an update is introducing major data structure or logic changes.
